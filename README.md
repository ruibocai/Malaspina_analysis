# Malaspina_analysis
all the metabarcodes in the malaspina dataset were mapped to the wrold map one by one, with each on one page of a pdf file. So there are more than 5000 pages in total. in the page, the title is organised in this way: "sequence number"_"the frequency of the sequence occuring in all samples". 
The 'sequence number" is taken from the 'SEMINAL' column of the original table we got from Ramon.
In the mapping file, you will see the frequency of some sequences is bigger than the number of dots in the figure (each dot represents one sampling station), this is because in the original table, in some station, more than one samples have been investigated.
